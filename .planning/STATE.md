### Key Decisions Made

See `.planning/PROJECT.md` Key Decisions table for full list.

Summary from v1.0:
- YAML frontmatter for specs (human-readable)
- Hybrid spec-database architecture
- Structured claude-progress.txt for determinism
- Validation gates as STEP 8 before commits
- Markdown MCP responses for token efficiency
- Localhost-only CORS for security

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

From `.planning/codebase/CONCERNS.md`:
- Silent exception handling in WebSocket code
- No structured logging framework (addressed by Phase 6)
- Test coverage gaps in core modules (addressed by Phase 8)
- Resource limits/env sanitization helpers ready but not wired in (documented by Phase 7)
