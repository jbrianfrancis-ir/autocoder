# v1.1 Foundation Hardening - Milestone Audit

**Milestone Goal:** Improve observability, document security posture, and add test confidence for core modules.

**Audited:** 2026-01-18
**Status:** PASSED

## Executive Summary

All 7 requirements satisfied. All 3 phases verified and complete. Cross-phase integration verified with no blocking issues. Minor tech debt accumulated (2 items, non-critical).

## Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Description | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------------|-------|--------|
| LOG-01 | Consistent log format (timestamp, level, module, message) | Phase 6 | ✓ SATISFIED |
| LOG-02 | Configurable log levels via environment | Phase 6 | ✓ SATISFIED |
| SEC-01 | Exact integration points for resource limits documented | Phase 7 | ✓ SATISFIED |
| SEC-02 | Environment sanitization locations documented | Phase 7 | ✓ SATISFIED |
| SEC-03 | "How to wire in" guidance for each helper | Phase 7 | ✓ SATISFIED |
| TEST-01 | Unit tests for core session loop | Phase 8 | ✓ SATISFIED |
| TEST-02 | Tests for error handling paths | Phase 8 | ✓ SATISFIED |

**Score:** 7/7 requirements satisfied

## Phase Verification Summary

| Phase | Goal | Status | Verified |
|-------|------|--------|----------|
| 6. Structured Logging | Consistent, configurable logging | ✓ PASSED (3/3) | 2026-01-16 |
| 7. Security Documentation | BLAST_RADIUS.md wiring guidance | ✓ PASSED (4/4) | 2026-01-16 |
| 8. Agent Testing | Core agent session loop tests | ✓ PASSED (3/3) | 2026-01-16 |

**Score:** 3/3 phases verified

## Cross-Phase Integration

### Phase Exports Consumed

| Export | Source | Consumed By | Status |
|--------|--------|-------------|--------|
| `configure_logging()` | Phase 6 | server/main.py, autonomous_agent_demo.py, mcp_server/feature_mcp.py | ✓ WIRED |
| `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)` | Phase 6 | 16 modules | ✓ WIRED |
| LOG_LEVEL env var | Phase 6 | Runtime configuration | ✓ WIRED |
| BLAST_RADIUS.md Section 7 | Phase 7 | Developer documentation | ✓ COMPLETE |
| `apply_resource_limits()` | Phase 7 (docs) | Not yet wired (documented) | DEFERRED |
| `get_safe_environment()` | Phase 7 (docs) | Not yet wired (documented) | DEFERRED |
| tests/conftest.py fixtures | Phase 8 | tests/test_agent.py | ✓ WIRED |
| tests/test_agent.py | Phase 8 | pytest runner | ✓ WIRED |

**Integration Score:** 10/10 expected connections verified

### Cross-Phase Gaps

None. Phases are appropriately decoupled:
- Phase 8 tests agent logic, not logging/security infrastructure (correct scope)
- Security helpers documented but not wired (Phase 7 was documentation-only, as intended)

## E2E Flow Verification

| Flow | Steps | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| Configure Logging → Run Agent → Verify Logs | User runs CLI → logging configured → logs appear | ✓ COMPLETE |
| Run Tests → Verify Pass | User runs pytest → 13 tests collected → all pass | ✓ COMPLETE |
| Read Docs → Apply Wiring | User reads BLAST_RADIUS.md → finds instructions → can apply | ✓ COMPLETE |

**Flow Score:** 3/3 flows complete

## Tech Debt

### Phase 8: Agent Testing

| Item | Severity | Impact |
|------|----------|--------|
| pytest-asyncio not in requirements.txt | LOW | Tests work but dependency not explicitly declared for new developers |

**Recommendation:** Add `pytest-asyncio>=0.24.0` to requirements.txt

### Phase 7: Security Documentation

| Item | Severity | Impact |
|------|----------|--------|
| Security helpers documented but not wired | LOW | Intentional - documentation complete, wiring is future work |

**Note:** This is expected behavior per phase scope. Documentation provides complete wiring instructions for when security hardening is prioritized.

## Verification Artifacts

| Phase | Verification File | Plans Complete |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|
| 6 | `.planning/phases/6-structured-logging/6-VERIFICATION.md` | 3/3 |
| 7 | `.planning/phases/7-security-documentation/7-VERIFICATION.md` | 1/1 |
| 8 | `.planning/phases/8-agent-testing/8-VERIFICATION.md` | 2/2 |

## Conclusion

**v1.1 Foundation Hardening milestone is COMPLETE.**

All requirements satisfied. All phases verified. Cross-phase integration confirmed. Minor tech debt (2 items) accumulated but non-blocking.

The milestone successfully delivered:
1. **Observability** - Structured logging with consistent format across all modules
2. **Security posture** - Complete documentation of how to wire in security helpers
3. **Test confidence** - 13 passing tests covering core agent session loop
